# GitHub Repository Display App

This application displays all the GitHub repositories for a given user and is based on [this tutorial](https://gonehybrid.com/build-your-first-mobile-app-with-ionic-2-angular-2-part-5/).

## Prerequisites
You will need to install the following software.
* [Node.js and npm](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/environment) and 
* [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

## Caveats
The following software versions were used in development.
* Node.js v8.15.1
* npm v6.4.1
* Ionic v5.2.1

There may be forward compatibility issues as the **http requests** in Ionic v5.2.1 still return *Promises,* whereas the later versions of Ionic return *Observables.*
